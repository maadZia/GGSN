# Deep Graph Neural Networks Course â€“ Assignments and Project

This repository contains coursework and a final project for the **Deep Graph Neural Networks** course. The work is divided into two main sections:

## ðŸ“‚ Assignments

Each file in the `assignments/` directory is a standalone Jupyter Notebook solving a specific optimization task related to hyperparameter tuning of deep learning models. Every notebook follows a structured, step-by-step approach and includes:

* a brief description of chosen dataset (downloaded from Kaggle)
* model selection and explanation
* hyperparameter optimization process (with code and rationale)
* intermediate and final results with comments
* model comparison using appropriate metrics and visualizations
* conclusions based on experimental outcomes

### Current assignments:

1. **Tabular Data Optimization** â€“ hyperparameter tuning for models trained on structured dataset
2. **Image Data Optimization** â€“ model optimization on computer vision tasks
3. **Sequential Data Optimization** â€“ experiments with text-sequence-based dataset

## ðŸ“‚ Project

The `project/` directory contains a separate notebook dedicated to the final project, focused on a chosen research problem. The format and methodology are consistent with the assignments but are applied to a custom-defined task of interest.
